Build against all the following databases
mvn clean install -Pmysql-db
mvn clean install -Pjpa -Pmysql-db
mvn clean install -Phsqldb-db

Run the executable jar

java -jar learnintouch-data-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

The project svn repository is at 
http://thalasoft.svn.storehouseapp.com/repository/

Add the project repository in Eclipse, in the perspective SVN Repositories.

Add the integration/java and integration/resources to the Java Build Path in Eclipse.

Create a db_integration database in MySQL.
bin/mysqladmin -u root -p create db_integration

Have a .m2/settings.xml file to avoid the issue of having the spring-data-source.xml file not being found on the classpath. See http://maven.40175.n5.nabble.com/A-classpath-issue-td3300543.html

If having the following error at build time:
ERROR JDBCExceptionReporter:78 - Communications link failure
then this is because of some incorrect setup with localhost in the system.
Using dataSource.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/db_integration
instead of dataSource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db_integration
should resolve the issue.
